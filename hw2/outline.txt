How tags are used:

<article>: Used to encapsulate all of the related <section> and <header> content within the page. A single <header> is used to define what the rest of the article will be about.
<aside>:   Used for content that is somewhat related to the rest of the page but if removed, the rest of the page would still make sense.
<nav>:     Used to contain links which navigate the user to other pages within the same website.
<section>: Used to encapsulate related content about a topic. Tags such as <p>, headings (<h1> - <h6>), <img>, <table>, will be grouped together to create a <section>.

  The "other.html" page is the only one that contains all 3 elements and 3 attributes in the same page.
  In the other pages, the "hidden" attribute is the only one that gets used consistently.

  The elements I used that were not discussed in class are <code>, <cite>, and <kbd>.
  The attributes I used that were not discussed in class are hidden, dir, translate.

  Elements:
  <kbd>     - Used to distinguish text as keyboard keys. (other.html)
  <cite>    - Used to cite from whom I got my quotes from. (other.html)
  <code>    - Used to signify to the user that this particular piece of "code" can be pasted
              into their respective Linux terminal. (other.html)

  Attributes:
  hidden    - Used to hide certain elements from the user. Usually used with JavaScript
              (used in the footer of all pages to hide a certain <p> element).
  dir       - Used to inform the browser of which way the text is oriented (i.e. left-to-right
              or right-to-left)
  translate - Used to inform the browser whether or not to translate the particular text that
              has this attribute.

          <p>
            Since 1983, the Free Software Movement has campaigned for computer
            users' freedom—for users to control the software they use, rather
            than vice versa. When a program respects users' freedom and
            community, we call it “free software.”
          </p>
          <p>
            We also sometimes call it “libre software” to emphasize that we're
            talking about liberty, not price. Some proprietary (nonfree)
            programs, such as Photoshop, are very expensive; others, such as the
            Uber app, are available gratis—but that's a minor detail. Either
            way, they give the program's developer power over the users, power
            that no one should have.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those two nonfree programs have something else in common: they are
            both malware. That is, both have functionalities designed to
            mistreat the user. Proprietary software nowadays is often malware
            because
            <a
              href="https://www.gnu.org/malware"

              title="Proprietary Software Is Often Malware"
              >the developers' power corrupts them</a
            >. That directory lists around 500 different malicious
            functionalities (as of January, 2021), but it is surely just the tip
            of the iceberg.
          </p>
          <p>
            With free software, the users control the program, both individually
            and collectively. So they control what their computers do (assuming
            those computers are
            <a
              href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/loyal-computers.html"

              >loyal</a
            >
            and do what the users' programs tell them to do).
          </p>
          <p>
            With proprietary software, the program controls the users, and some
            other entity (the developer or “owner”) controls the program. So the
            proprietary program gives its developer power over its users. That
            is unjust in itself; moreover, it tempts the developer to mistreat
            the users in other ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even when proprietary software isn't downright malicious, its
            developers have an incentive to make it
            <a

            developers have an ethical obligation not to do that, but generally
            they follow their interests. If you want this not to happen, make
            sure the program is controlled by its users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Freedom means having control over your own life. If you use a
            program to carry out activities in your life, your freedom depends
            on your having control over the program. You deserve to have control
            over the programs you use, and all the more so when you use them for
            something important in your life.
          </p>

            Users' control over the program requires four

                  The freedom to run the program as you wish, for whatever
                  purpose.

                  The freedom to study the program's “source code,” and change
                  it, so the program does your computing as you wish. Programs
                  are written by programmers in a programming language—like
                  English combined with algebra—and that form of the program is
                  the “source code.” Anyone who knows programming, and has the
                  program in source code form, can read the source code,
                  understand its functioning, and change it too. When all you
                  get is the executable form, a series of numbers that are
                  efficient for the computer to run but extremely hard for a
                  human being to understand, understanding and changing the
                  program in that form are forbiddingly hard.

                  program is free, that doesn't mean someone has an obligation
                  to offer you a copy, or that you have an obligation to offer
                  him a copy. Distributing a program to users without freedom
                  mistreats them; however, choosing not to distribute the
                  program—using it privately—does not mistreat anyone.)

            The first two freedoms mean each user can exercise individual
            control over the program. With the other two freedoms, any group of
            users can together exercise collective control over the program.
            With all four freedoms, the users fully control the program. If any
            of them is missing or inadequate, the program is proprietary
            (nonfree), and unjust.

            Other kinds of works are also used for practical activities,
            including recipes for cooking, educational works such as textbooks,
            reference works such as dictionaries and encyclopedias, fonts for
            displaying paragraphs of text, circuit diagrams for hardware for
            people to build, and patterns for making useful (not merely
            decorative) objects with a 3D printer. Since these are not software,
            the free software movement strictly speaking doesn't cover them; but
            the same reasoning applies and leads to the same conclusion: these
            works should carry the four freedoms.
          </p>
          <p>
            A free program allows you to tinker with it to make it do what you
            want (or cease to do something you dislike). Tinkering with software
            may sound ridiculous if you are accustomed to proprietary software
            as a sealed box, but in the Free World it's a common thing to do,
            and a good way to learn programming. Even the traditional American
            pastime of tinkering with cars is obstructed because cars now
            contain nonfree software.

          <h2>The Injustice of Proprietariness</h2>
          <p>
            If the users don't control the program, the program controls the
            users. With proprietary software, there is always some entity, the
            developer or “owner” of the program, that controls the program—and
            through it, exercises power over its users. A nonfree program is a
            yoke, an instrument of unjust power.
          </p>

            does all of these, and so does Windows on mobile devices with ARM
            chips. Windows, mobile phone firmware, and Google Chrome for Windows
            include a universal back door that allows some company to change the
            program remotely without asking permission. The Amazon Kindle has a
            back door that can erase books.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of nonfree software in the “internet of things” would turn
            it into the

            With the goal of ending the injustice of nonfree software, the free
            software movement develops free programs so users can free
            themselves. We began in 1984 by developing the free operating system

            Distributing a program to users without freedom mistreats those
            users; however, choosing not to distribute the program does not
            mistreat anyone. If you write a program and use it privately, that
            does no wrong to others. (You do miss an opportunity to do good, but
            that's not the same as doing wrong.) Thus, when we say all software
            must be free, we mean that every copy must come with the four
            freedoms, but we don't mean that someone has an obligation to offer
            you a copy.

          <h2>Nonfree Software and SaaSS</h2>
          <p>
            Nonfree software was the first way for companies to take control of
            people's computing. Nowadays, there is another way, called Service
            as a Software Substitute, or SaaSS. That means letting someone
            else's server do your own computing tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            SaaSS doesn't mean the programs on the server are nonfree (though
            they often are). Rather, using SaaSS causes the same injustices as
            using a nonfree program: they are two paths to the same bad place.
            Take the example of a SaaSS translation service: The user sends text
            to the server, and the server translates it (from English to
            Spanish, say) and sends the translation back to the user. Now the
            job of translating is under the control of the server operator
            rather than the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use SaaSS, the server operator controls your computing. It
            requires entrusting all the pertinent data to the server operator,
            which will be forced to show it to the state as well—<a
              href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html"
              target="_blank"
              title="Who does that server really serve?"
              >who does that server really serve, after all?</a
            >
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Primary And Secondary Injustices</h2>
          <p>
            When you use proprietary programs or SaaSS, first of all you do
            wrong to yourself, because it gives some entity unjust power over
            you. For your own sake, you should escape. It also wrongs others if
            you make a promise not to share. It is evil to keep such a promise,
            and a lesser evil to break it; to be truly upright, you should not
            make the promise at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are cases where using nonfree software puts pressure directly
            on others to do likewise. Skype is a clear example: when one person
            uses the nonfree Skype client software, it requires another person
            to use that software too—thus both surrender their freedom. (Google
            Hangouts have the same problem.) It is wrong even to suggest using
            such programs. We should refuse to use them even briefly, even on
            someone else's computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another harm of using nonfree programs and SaaSS is that it rewards
            the perpetrator, encouraging further development of that program or
            “service,” leading in turn to even more people falling under the
            company's thumb.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the forms of indirect harm are magnified when the user is a
            public entity or a school.

          <h2>Free Software and the State</h2>
          <p>
            Public agencies exist for the people, not for themselves. When they
            do computing, they do it for the people. They have a duty to
            maintain full control over that computing so that they can assure it
            is done properly for the people. (This constitutes the computational
            sovereignty of the state.) They must never allow control over the
            state's computing to fall into private hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            To maintain control of the people's computing, public agencies must
            not do it with proprietary software (software under the control of
            an entity other than the state). And they must not entrust it to a
            service programmed and run by an entity other than the state, since
            this would be SaaSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Proprietary software has no security at all in one crucial
            case—against its developer. And the developer may help others
            attack.

            country uses such software, it endangers national security. Do you
            want the NSA to break into your government's computers?

          <h2>Free Software and Education</h2>
          <p>
            Schools (and this includes all educational activities) influence the
            future of society through what they teach. They should teach
            exclusively free software, so as to use their influence for the
            good. To teach a proprietary program is to implant dependence, which
            goes against the mission of education. By training in use of free
            software, schools will direct society's future towards freedom, and
            help talented programmers master the craft.
          </p>
          <p>
            They will also teach students the habit of cooperating, helping
            other people. Each class should have this rule: “Students, this
            class is a place where we share our knowledge. If you bring software
            to class, you may not keep it for yourself. Rather, you must share
            copies with the rest of the class—including the program's source
            code, in case someone else wants to learn. Therefore, bringing
            proprietary software to class is not permitted except to reverse
            engineer it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Proprietary developers would have us punish students who are good
            enough at heart to share software and thwart those curious enough to
            want to change it. This means a bad education. See more discussion

          <h2>Free Software: More Than “Advantages”</h2>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="./images/fsf-linux-pepe.png"
              alt="Free Software Foundation and Linux Tux Rare Pepes"
            />
          </figure>
          <p>
            I'm often asked to describe the “advantages” of free software. But
            the word “advantages” is too weak when it comes to freedom. Life
            without freedom is oppression, and that applies to computing as well
            as every other activity in our lives. We must refuse to give the
            developers of the programs or computing services control over the
            computing we do. This is the right thing to do, for selfish reasons;
            but not solely for selfish reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Freedom includes the freedom to cooperate with others. Denying
            people that freedom means keeping them divided, which is the start
            of a scheme to oppress them. In the free software community, we are
            very much aware of the importance of the freedom to cooperate
            because our work consists of organized cooperation. If your friend
            comes to visit and sees you use a program, she might ask for a copy.
            A program which stops you from redistributing it, or says you're
            “not supposed to,” is antisocial.
          </p>
          <p>
            In computing, cooperation includes redistributing exact copies of a
            program to other users. It also includes distributing your changed
            versions to them. Free software encourages these forms of
            cooperation, while proprietary software forbids them. It forbids
            redistribution of copies, and by denying users the source code, it
            blocks them from making changes. SaaSS has the same effects: if your
            computing is done over the web in someone else's server, by someone
            else's copy of a program, you can't see it or touch the software
            that does your computing, so you can't redistribute it or change it.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            We deserve to have control of our own computing. How can we win this
            control?

                regularly use, and rejecting SaaSS.

            We and thousands of users have done this since 1984, which is how we
            now have the free GNU/Linux operating system that anyone—programmer
            or not—can use. Join our cause, as a programmer or an activist.
            Let's make all computer users free.

  The "other.html" page is the only one that contains all 3 elements and 3 attributes in the same page.
  In the other pages, the "hidden" attribute is the only one that gets used consistently.

  The elements I used that were not discussed in class are <code>, <cite>, and <kbd>.
  The attributes I used that were not discussed in class are hidden, dir, translate.

  Elements:
  <kbd>     - Used to distinguish text as keyboard keys. (other.html)
  <cite>    - Used to cite from whom I got my quotes from. (other.html)
  <code>    - Used to signify to the user that this particular piece of "code" can be pasted
              into their respective Linux terminal. (other.html)

  Attributes:
  hidden    - Used to hide certain elements from the user. Usually used with JavaScript
              (used in the footer of all pages to hide a certain <p> element).
  dir       - Used to inform the browser of which way the text is oriented (i.e. left-to-right
              or right-to-left)
  translate - Used to inform the browser whether or not to translate the particular text that
              has this attribute.

            When you hear the word "Linux," you may automatically think about
            the heavy-duty computer users who embraced the technology a couple
            of decades ago. And that's reasonable, but as CBT Nuggets Linux
            trainer Shawn Powers says in a recent Trainer Talk, "Linux is just
            not as scary and mysterious as everybody seems to think."
          </p>
          <p>
            In recent years, the open source operating system has become so
            user-friendly, anyone can install and work with it. But that isn't
            the only reason Linux is the right choice for your business. Tech
            professionals have long chosen Linux for their servers and computers
            due to its security. But why is Linux considered more secure than
            other operating systems?
          </p>
          <p>
            Although security often comes down to end-user training regardless
            of OS, there are some things that make Linux systems more secure
            than other environments. This is especially true when it comes to
            malicious software. Here are a few reasons your devices will be more
            secure with a Linux operating system in place.
          </p>

          <h2>Hackers don't typically target Linux</h2>
          <p>
            The most cited reason for Linux's safety relates to its low usage
            numbers. Linux has less than three percent of the market, compared
            to Windows, which operates on more than 80 percent of all devices.
            Microsoft and Linux are practically friends now, so that might
            change a little. (Probably to Microsoft's favor.) For those creating
            malicious software, it makes more sense to target Windows, because
            one piece of code will reach the largest segment of the population.
            This keeps Linux users safer, as even Mac has a larger segment of
            the market.
          </p>

          <h2>
            It's more difficult to execute a dangerous attachment in the Linux
            OS
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you've never worked with Linux, you may not realize that it
            doesn't operate quite the same as Windows or Mac. In those
            environments, opening a dangerous attachment is simply a matter of
            double-clicking. Linux is easy to learn with the right resources,
            but there are extra steps to take before executing a malicious
            software. On Linux, users need to save the attachment before
            executing it, and if set up correctly, they would need permissions
            granted before they could open it. These extra steps can help
            safeguard a business from the internal user Kill that is so often
            the cause of security breaches.

          <h2>Linux does not give users admin access by default</h2>

          <p>
            In a Windows environment, users are often given a high level of
            access automatically. This lets them click on links and download
            files indiscriminately, easily leading to the issues mentioned
            above. Many users don't have access to the root directories on their
            computers, which means that even if they do manage to infect their
            systems, they'll be limited in the damage they can do. Of course,
            good security practices mean that users shouldn't be clicking those
            links in the first place. Regardless of what device you use, it
            ultimately comes down to whether your users employ good security
            awareness practices — and it's up to you to train them.

          <h2>Linux has more people looking out for security issues</h2>
          <p>
            Although Microsoft has an army of developers working on their OS,
            the number of developers working on Linux is bigger. And that's one
            of the biggest reasons to go Linux. With so many people monitoring
            for issues, it's likely someone will catch a vulnerability long
            before hackers can target it. Once spotted, Linux users don't have
            to wait months for Microsoft to finally investigate the issue and
            fix it. They can repair it themselves, from wherever they are. This
            not only improves security for the platform, but it also keeps
            things stable to prevent downtime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Linux may be safer, there are things administrators can do
            to keep systems safe. If a hacker does target your network, these
            small measures will either prevent it or minimize any damage it
            might do. This includes encrypting the hard drive of each device,
            which can be done at the time of installation. A firewall can also
            help keep your systems safe, and best of all, you have plenty of
            options available for free. Lastly, make sure you keep all your
            software up-to-date, just as you would do with any operating system.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have been thinking about making the switch to Linux, there
            has never been a better time. With so much training available to
            help you learn the basics, you'll be able to deploy Linux within
            your network infrastructure with minimal effort. Once you have Linux
            in place, you can build from there, boosting the security across
            your entire network.

          <p>
            “Security through obscurity” may be a catchy phrase, but it’s not
            the only thing that’s catching among Windows users. The expression
            is intended to suggest that proprietary software is more secure by
            virtue of its closed nature. If hackers can’t see the code, then
            it’s harder for them to create exploits for it–or so the thinking
            goes. Unfortunately for Windows users, that’s just not true–as
            evidenced by the never-ending parade of patches coming out of
            Redmond. In fact, one of Linux’s many advantages over Windows is
            that it is more secure–much more. For small businesses and other
            organizations without a dedicated staff of security experts, that
            benefit can be particularly critical. Five key factors underlie
            Linux’s superior security:
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Privileges</h2>
          <p>
            Linux systems are by no means infallible, but one of their key
            advantages lies in the way account privileges are assigned. In
            Windows, users are generally given administrator access by default,
            which means they pretty much have access to everything on the
            system, even its most crucial parts. So, then, do viruses. It’s like
            giving terrorists high-level government positions.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Linux, on the other hand, users do not usually have such “root”
            privileges; rather, they’re typically given lower-level accounts.
            What that means is that even if a Linux system is compromised, the
            virus won’t have the root access it would need to do damage
            systemwide; more likely, just the user’s local files and programs
            would be affected. That can make the difference between a minor
            annoyance and a major catastrophe in any business setting.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Social Engineering</h2>
          <p>
            Viruses and worms often spread by convincing computer users to do
            something they shouldn’t, like open attachments that carry viruses
            and worms. This is called social engineering, and it’s all too easy
            on Windows systems. Just send out an e-mail with a malicious
            attachment and a subject line like, “Check out these adorable
            puppies!”–or the porn equivalent–and some proportion of users is
            bound to click without thinking. The result? An open door for the
            attached malware, with potentially disastrous consequences
            organizationwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to the fact that most Linux users don’t have root access,
            however, it’s much harder to accomplish any real damage on a Linux
            system by getting them to do something foolish. Before any real
            damage could occur, a Linux user would have to read the e-mail, save
            the attachment, give it executable permissions and then run the
            executable. Not very likely, in other words.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The Monoculture Effect</h2>
          <p>
            However you want to argue the exact numbers, there’s no doubt that
            Microsoft Windows still dominates most of the computing world. In
            the realm of e-mail, so too do Outlook and Outlook Express. And
            therein lies a problem: It’s essentially a monoculture, which is no
            better in technology than it is in the natural world. Just as
            genetic diversity is a good thing in the natural world because it
            minimizes the deleterious effects of a deadly virus, so a diversity
            of computing environments helps protect users.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fortunately, a diversity of environments is yet another benefit that
            Linux offers. There’s Ubuntu, there’s Debian, there’s Gentoo, and
            there are many other distributions. There are also many shells, many
            packaging systems, and many mail clients; Linux even runs on many
            architectures beyond just Intel. So, whereas a virus can be targeted
            squarely at Windows users, since they all use pretty much the same
            technology, reaching more than a small faction of Linux users is
            much more difficult. Who wouldn’t want to give their company that
            extra layer of assurance?
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Audience Size</h2>
          <p>
            Hand-in-hand with this monoculture effect comes the not particularly
            surprising fact that the majority of viruses target Windows, and the
            desktops in your organization are no exception. Millions of people
            all using the same software make an attractive target for malicious
            attacks.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>How Many Eyeballs</h2>
          <p>
            “Linus’ Law”–named for Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux–holds
            that, “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.” What that means
            is that the larger the group of developers and testers working on a
            set of code, the more likely any flaws will be caught and fixed
            quickly. This, in other words, is essentially the polar opposite of
            the “security through obscurity” argument.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Windows, it’s a limited set of paid developers who are trying
            to find problems in the code. They adhere to their own set
            timetables, and they don’t generally tell anyone about the problems
            until they’ve already created a solution, leaving the door open to
            exploits until that happens. Not a very comforting thought for the
            businesses that depend on that technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Linux world, on the other hand, countless users can see the
            code at any time, making it more likely that someone will find a
            flaw sooner rather than later. Not only that, but users can even fix
            problems themselves. Microsoft may tout its large team of paid
            developers, but it’s unlikely that team can compare with a global
            base of Linux user-developers around the globe. Security can only
            benefit through all those extra “eyeballs.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Once again, none of this is to say that Linux is impervious; no
            operating system is. And there are definitely steps Linux users
            should take to make their systems as secure as possible, such as
            enabling a firewall, minimizing the use of root privileges, and
            keeping the system up to date. For extra peace of mind there are
            also virus scanners available for Linux, including ClamAV. These are
            particularly good measures for small businesses, which likely have
            more at stake than individual users do.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s also worth noting that security firm Secunia recently declared
            that Apple products have more security vulnerabilities than any
            others–including Microsoft’s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Either way, however, when it comes to security, there’s no doubt
            that Linux users have a lot less to worry about.

  The "other.html" page is the only one that contains all 3 elements and 3 attributes in the same page.
  In the other pages, the "hidden" attribute is the only one that gets used consistently.

  The elements I used that were not discussed in class are <code>, <cite>, and <kbd>.
  The attributes I used that were not discussed in class are hidden, dir, translate.

  Elements:
  <kbd>     - Used to distinguish text as keyboard keys. (other.html)
  <cite>    - Used to cite from whom I got my quotes from. (other.html)
  <code>    - Used to signify to the user that this particular piece of "code" can be pasted
              into their respective Linux terminal. (other.html)

  Attributes:
  hidden    - Used to hide certain elements from the user. Usually used with JavaScript
              (used in the footer of all pages to hide a certain <p> element).
  dir       - Used to inform the browser of which way the text is oriented (i.e. left-to-right
              or right-to-left)
  translate - Used to inform the browser whether or not to translate the particular text that
              has this attribute.

          <p>
            You’re probably using Windows or macOS if you’re reading this. No
            matter what you’re using currently, you will find a lot of use-cases
            where Linux is better than Windows and also cases where it’s better
            than Mac. In case you’re new to all this and confused about what
            “Linux” actually is — I recommend you to first read one of our
            previous articles to know what Linux is. Now that I assume you know
            what Linux is — I must make it clear that I’m not leaning towards
            the statement — “Linux or nothing”. But, if you haven’t used a Linux
            distro, you’re missing out on a lot of good things. So, if you’re
            planning to give Linux a try — there are several reasons to do so.
            In this article, I’m going to highlight eleven reasons why you
            should Linux and never look back.

          <h2>1. It’s free: No license, no fees</h2>
          <p>
            Linux is completely free to use unlike Microsoft Windows or macOS.
            You don’t need to purchase any kind of licenses (or shell out cash
            for specific hardware) to use it for personal or commercial use.
            With a couple of hundred bucks saved, you can use it to upgrade your
            hardware, purchase premium services or anything better that you can
            think of. Isn’t that exciting?

          <h2>2. More Secure: Antivirus not required</h2>
          <p>
            To be honest, every platform has its share of issues. However, Linux
            is one of the most secure platforms when compared to macOS and
            Windows. With a big community of developers/users, even if someone
            finds a problem, it gets fixed quickly. However, sometimes with
            macOS and Windows, I’ve noticed that it takes a lot of time for them
            to fix the issues in a future update. And, of course, you don’t
            necessarily need an antivirus program on Linux. So, you also save on
            yearly/monthly subscriptions for Antivirus programs on
            Windows/macOS. Yes, one could argue that the market share of Linux
            on Desktop is lower than Windows/macOS. So, attackers don’t always
            target Linux users and hence, there aren’t any widespread security
            issues being spotted. Even if that’s true (let’s assume), would you
            prefer to use something that’s safer to use or something that’s a
            magnet to virus, malware, and adware? I’ll respect your decision
            with that.

          <h2>3. Compatible with old and low-end hardware</h2>
          <p>
            Microsoft’s latest Windows 10 doesn’t work very well with older
            computers and you know that. macOS is a different story because you
            don’t really have the option of choosing your own hardware — so
            there’s nothing to talk about here. But, Linux is easily compatible
            with low-end hardware and IoT devices as well. In fact, you will
            find some specific lightweight Linux distros tailored for old
            computers. Not just limited to that, you can also fire up a Linux
            distro on a Raspberry Pi or its alternatives to set up a basic
            system or work on DIY project. If you still don’t believe me, I
            recommend you to check out the best Raspberry Pi OS available out
            there.

          <h2>4. It’s not that complicated to use</h2>
          <p>
            With Linux distributions like Pop!_OS, Ubuntu, Manjaro and many
            others, Linux is easier than ever. You can get almost anything done
            using a GUI (Graphical User Interface) and you don’t need to type
            any commands. Yes, you can do a lot of things if you know how to use
            the terminal quickly. And, you might come across some distributions
            that are meant for experienced Linux users. But, you will find
            plenty of documentations/help resources online to follow without
            relying on anyone.

          <h2>5. Drivers installed automatically</h2>
          <p>
            Drivers scene has improved on Windows 10 as well but it has always
            been better on Linux. Almost all drivers are automatically installed
            on your system. If there are more than one drivers available, you
            can choose to install the one you want.

          <h2>6. Customize the looks of your desktop as much you like</h2>
          <p>
            Starting from the icon pack to the application window, you can
            change the look and feel of a Linux distro in minutes. In case you
            want to explore, you can refer to our list of the best GNOME themes
            and best icons for your Linux distro.Not just limited to theme, you
            can also change the desktop environment of your distro to KDE,
            GNOME, MATE, and others.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Desktop Environment basically changes the overall user interface
            of your OS. You can take a look the best desktop environments
            available to know what I’m referring to. In case you want a
            Windows-like interface on Linux, fear not, you have plenty of
            Windows-like distributions that you can install.

          <h2>7. Software center to get all apps in one place</h2>
          <p>
            It’s easy to install software on Linux using the software center (or
            the app center or the package manager). The collection of software
            available is usually huge and actively maintained. This is not
            something exclusive to Linux, you can find Microsoft Store for
            Windows as well. But, the point is, it’s not difficult to find and
            install applications on Linux.

            8. Hassle-free updates: Update your system as well as installed
            software
          </h2>
          <p>
            Linux has got a strong track record of hassle-free updates unlike
            Windows. It not only updates your system but it also updates
            installed software. How cool is that! Not to mention, I have to
            re-configure my audio configuration every time a Windows update
            arrives.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a nutshell, with every Windows update, something goes wrong. If
            you’re lucky enough, you may not have noticed any issues but it’s a
            mess with Windows updates. Also, the most annoying thing with
            Windows is its background update download and later forcing you to
            update your system. Wait, you also have to reboot every time you get
            a Window/macOS update? That can be inconvenient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, on Linux, you don’t necessarily need to reboot and the
            updates are mostly error-free. And, that’s why Linux is the perfect
            choice for enterprises and servers. In fact, there’s an entertaining
            video by the fine folks at SUSE which highlights “don’t reboot it,
            just patch it”.

          <h2>9. Gaming on Linux</h2>
          <p>
            In the past, one of the major constraints while switching to Linux
            was gaming. While Linux had some native games, thanks to Steam Play,
            now you can play ‘Windows only’ games on Linux.You may not be able
            to play “every” Windows game on Linux yet. However, you can enjoy
            most of the latest AAA games and older titles without any issues.
            You can read more about gaming on Linux to see all the options to
            game on a Linux system.

          <h2>10. Community support</h2>
          <p>
            Probably the best thing about Linux is the community of users
            itself. Not just blogs/publications like ours — but you can interact
            with people to get help on numerous forums. You will find a lot of
            helpful users online who will go an extra mile to help you out. So,
            you’re not alone, we’re a family here! Well, we also have our

          <h2>11. Linux is Open Source</h2>
          <p>
            If you like to have transparency on what you use on a day-to-day
            basis, Linux (in general) is the perfect choice to have. Unlike
            Windows/macOS, Linux relies on the concept of
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source"
              target="_blank"
              title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source"
              >open-source software</a
            >. So, you can easily review the source code of your operating
            system to see how it works or how it handles your data. For
            instance, you get a car but you’re not allowed to see what’s inside,
            wouldn’t you be annoyed? That’s how Windows/macOS works — but with
            Linux, you are allowed to see what’s inside without any
            restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fret not, if you don’t have the required expertise to understand the
            source code, there are thousands of developers/contributors who
            constantly work on fixing the issues (if there’s anything at all).
            You don’t have to trust a company, right? So, with an open-source
            community, it’s the people/users who’re largely responsible for
            fixing issues or help to improve it.

          <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
          <p>
            Linux is something that anyone ranging from an average Joe to a
            system admin can utilize. So, if you find these reasons compelling
            enough, make the switch! Personally, I’ve been using Linux for
            several years now and I’ve never looked back. What about you? Feel
